Hi, my name is **Thiago Kenji Okada**. I have a Master's degree in **Computer Science** and recently started working as a **Software Developer**.

My primary language of choice is [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), however I also have experience in [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [**Javascript**](https://www.javascript.com/). I am also a advanced Linux user, with some experience in systems administration. I am always trying to learn new things.

You can find more about my carrer in my [**Linkedin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-kenji-okada-65357933/), and you can find about projects that I contributed in my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/m45t3r) profile.
